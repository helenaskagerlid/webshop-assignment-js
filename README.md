# Monster Webshop

## About 

This webshop was a individual project we did in our Introduction Course in Javascript (JS). The assigment was to learn the basics in JS by creating a webshop from an imagined client. The client had specific requierments that we were expected to deliver to them. Over the course of 4 weeks I created this webshop.
